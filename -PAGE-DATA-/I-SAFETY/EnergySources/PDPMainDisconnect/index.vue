		<p>On the main power distribution panel (<b>PDP</b>), open the main electrical disconnect switch following the proper lockout /tagout procedures, including arc flash safety, and apply personal lock. If more than one person is to perform work on the machine, each employee is to place a personal lock on the energy source using a multiple lockout device (scissor lock). The main electrical disconnect will shut off the main power to the zone. Verify power is removed by indication on the <b>HMI</b> screen and attempting to start the machine.</p>
